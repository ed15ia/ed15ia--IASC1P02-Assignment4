								<h2 id="H2text">Description of Webpage</h2>
								<p>Since I was a child, I have been given the opportunity to play and watch several different types of sports.  I have played: hockey, basketball, soccer, golf and biking. My favourite two sports would probably be hockey and basketball because although they are team sports, they are very different, and can both be played at different times in the year. I also really enjoy Golf because it gives the player an opportunity to compete against themselves continuously trying to improve the score. I also love any activity that gives me the excuse to go outside during the summer! </p>

								<h3 id="Paragraph2">Hockey</h3>
								<p> Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to shoot a puck into the other team’s net. There are many different positions including forward, defense, and goalie. I have played hockey for several years and I have always enjoyed watching hockey. My position when I used to play was left winger. My favourite hockey teams are Toronto Maple Leaf’s, and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Hockey is a sport that is best enjoyed during the winter. </p>

								<h4 id="Paragraph3"> Basketball </h4>
								<p> Basketball is a team sport where two teams, usually with five players each compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. I played basketball a lot less than I have played hockey, but I do enjoy watching basketball. My favourite team to watch play are the Toronto Raptors. The Toronto Raptors won a championship last season and it felt amazing. I sometimes play basketball with my friends during the summer on a nice warm day. Basketball is a great form of exercise. </p>
