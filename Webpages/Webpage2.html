								<h3 id="Paragraph2">Chinese Food </h3>

								<p> When I eat Chinese food normally, I prefer to get takeout. My order usually has an egg roll, chicken fried rice, chicken balls, honey garlic chicken wings, and general Taoâ€™s chicken. Some other popular items that I often like to order include: beef with broccoli, sweet and sour spareribs, chicken chow mein, sweet & sour ribs, and wonton soup. However, sometimes I like to try new items on the menu from time to time. </p>

								<h4 id="Paragraph3"> Barbeque Foods</h4>
								<p>In the summer I often get the opportunity to enjoy some barbeque foods.  My favourite of all the barbequed foods would have to be a juicy sirloin steak. Other barbequed foods that I like include: hamburgers, rack of ribs, hotdogs, vegetables on the grill, and of course chicken. Although you can barbeque almost anything the options above are the ones I most frequently grill. </p>
