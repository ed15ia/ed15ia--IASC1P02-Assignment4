								<h2 id="H2text">Description of Webpage</h2>
								<p>This website will display and discuss all my favourite courses that I have taken while at Brock University. I am in my fourth year and have completed several interesting courses during my time here that I want to share with visitors of my website.  I am in the BBA program with a concentration in marketing. These discussions will include courses that focus on my concentration which is marketing and courses that I have elected to take or simply don’t relate to marketing.  I always enjoy taking new courses and experiencing the learning curve that takes place. </p>

								<h3 id="Paragraph2">Marketing Courses</h3>
								<p> I have taken a few marketing focused courses while at brock. Some of my favourite courses include: intro to marketing, marketing research, sales, marketing strategy, and internet and social media marketing. The reason intro to marketing has taught me a lot is the professor that led that course was extremely knowledgeable and relatable when it came to field experience.  I enjoyed marketing research because we were given the freedom to choose our own research project and I learned a lot of long-term knowledge from that course. I enjoyed taking sales because this is a career choice for me once I graduate and I enjoyed learning information about the sales topic. I enjoyed taking marketing strategy and internet and social media marketing because it allowed me to learn about new areas of marketing that I didn’t previously have a lot of training with. Overall, I am happy with my choice of education and if all goes well, I will be able to graduate this June 2020. </p>

								<h4 id="Paragraph3"> Other Interesting Courses</h4>
								<p> Over the last few years I have had the chance to take some outside courses that will not necessarily reflect my career path, but I have enjoyed none the less.  These courses include: web media production, extreme earth, business ethics, business law, corporate entrepreneurship, and management of information systems and technology. The reason I enjoyed this course web media production is it has allowed me to learn coding basics and put that information to the test on a weekly basis. I have wanted to learn how to code for a long time and I feel privileged to be given the opportunity to learn from home.  I enjoyed learning about the course extreme earth because it has taught me interesting facts about the science that goes on naturally on our planet and has helped explain things like earthquakes.  I enjoyed taking both business law and ethics because it has taught me the minor details that are extremely important to business. I have learned how ethics plays a strong role in all sizes of business and it has helped me form a plan for how I want to operate as a potential business man in the future. I enjoyed taking corporate entrepreneurship because this course discusses the innovation that happens at a corporate level and how a company comes up with new products or systems for consumers to enjoy. I also really enjoyed taking management of information systems and technology because Information systems and technologies have become crucial for firms to remain competitive in the digital world. </p>
